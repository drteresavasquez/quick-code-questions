// I was writing a loop and suddenly everything froze! My browser would not stop refreshing...I had to shut down my computer!

// Look at this loop and tell me 1. What is this called and 2. Why did it happen and how can I prevent it from happening again...

// DO NOT RUN THIS EVER!
// for (let i = 0; i >= 0; i++) {
//   console.log(i);
// }
