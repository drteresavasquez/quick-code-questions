// I have this array:
let array = ['Start Doing', 'Continue Doing', 'Stop Doing'];
// I like it just fine, but there is a time in my code that I need to empty that array out and start over again. Can anyone tell me how I could empty an array?

array = [];
console.log(array);

// Last one...So, ___ helped me figure out how to empty my array. Now, someone else tell me if I do this, what value will be console logged?
const outfit = ['jacket', 't-shirt', 'pants', 'knee-high socks'];
outfit.length = 0;
console.log(outfit[0]);
